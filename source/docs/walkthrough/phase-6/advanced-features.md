# Advanced features

Once you have several days or weeks of looping during the day and night, you may then want to consider some of the in-development additional features. See below for a high-level overview; and then see subsequent pages for details about setting these up. These are NOT turned on by default, and require manual configuration and additional work to use them.

## Meal-assist

If you choose to enable the optional meal-assist feature, then after you give yourself a meal bolus, the system can high-temp more quickly after a meal bolus IF you enter carbs reliably. So before considering meal-assist, you must be willing to enter carbs reliably, either through the pump's bolus wizard, or through the Nightscout Care Portal. If you don't want to do that, this feature won't be usable.

Like all features and steps, you'll want to carefully enable, test, and observe the outcomes of this feature.

## Auto-sensitivity mode

Wouldn't it be great if the system knew when you were running sensitive or resistant? That's what we thought, so we created "auto-sensitivity mode". If you explicitly configure this additional feature, it will allow the system to analyze historical data on the go and make adjustments if it recognizes that you are reacting more sensitivite (or conversely, more resistant) to insulin than usual. It will then make micro adjustments to your basals.

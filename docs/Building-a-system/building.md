# Building an OpenAPS Implementation

### Prerequisites

* Learn how to to go from [learning to use the openaps tools through practicing](../Using-openaps-Tools/using.md) to building your own OpenAPS system. 

* [Why you might take a DIY approach](http://bit.ly/1NBbZtO) for creating new tools and using the OpenAPS system development phases.

	* We cannot provide explicit instructions on how to construct a functional artificial pancreas 
	
	* We cannot recommend that you use the openaps tools for dosing insulin. 

## OpenAPS System Development Phases

The 5 phases build upon the openaps development tools towards a working OpenAPS system:

* [Phase 0: Initial Setup](../Building-a-system/initial-setup.md)<br>
Acquire and configure hardware, install software, and become familiar with the openaps environment

* [Phase 1: Data Collection](../Building-a-system/data-collection.md)<br>
Create tools for logging and analyzing pump and CGM data

* [Phase 2: Recommendation Engine](../Building-a-system/recommendation-engine.md)<br>
Use the logged data to suggest insulin dose adjustments, review and refine algorithms, test different scenarios for safety

* [Phase 3: Closing the Loop](../Building-a-system/closing-the-loop.md)<br>
Apply the recommendations automatically and in real time

* [Phase 4: Additional Modifications](../Building-a-system/getting-fancy.md)<br>
Improve the functionality of the system with additional software or hardware development

## Phase Structure

The document subsection for each phase has three components outlined:

* Upon Completion--The capabilities that the user and system should have after completing the phase  

* Phase Tasks--Tasks or steps to take during the phase

* Community Contribution--Users should be able to contribute to the **#OpenAPS** project and/or openaps development tool set during and after the phase.

The recommended phase descriptions serve as one possible path to step through the development process in a structured way.

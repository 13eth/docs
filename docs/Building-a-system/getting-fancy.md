# Phase 4: Additional Modifications

These efforts are certainly worthwhile and bring out the best in technological creativity, but they also tend to distract in the early stages of development.

After you've closed the loop, are running consistently and successfully and want to go to the next level, consider any of the following projects, in addition to contributing back with improvements to algorithms and tools in OpenAPS:

* Data visualization
* Smartphone integration
* On-board displays
* Hardware size reduction
* Hardware power consumption reduction
* Refined analytical modeling
* Integration with fitness trackers

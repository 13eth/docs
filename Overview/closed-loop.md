#What is Closed Loop? 
Different types of closed loop.

These steps are well-documented on the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) [Artificial Pancreas Project Plan](http://jdrf.org/research/treat/artificial-pancreas-project/) page.

 - Single vs. dual hormone
 - Various levels of pump activity
	 - Basal suspend (threshold, predictive)
	 - Basal adjust
	 - Fully automated

While the openaps tools do not limit a user, \#OpenAPS is focused on a single-hormone hybrid closed-loop systemâ€”that is, one that uses only insulin (no glucagon) and does not aim to replace user interaction for mealtime bolusing.

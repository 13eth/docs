#What is Closed Loop? 

In general, a "closed loop" system is one in which insulin dosing—and in some cases glucagon dosing—is partially or completely automated. This is in contrast to an "open loop" system, where the user evaluates the inputs and manually instructs the insulin pump to dose a specific amount. In both cases, the goal is to maintain blood glucose within the desired range through adjusting hormone doses.

There are numerous different types of closed loop systems, ranging from simple basal suspend (threshold, predictive)
	 - Basal adjust
	 - Fully automated
 - Single (insulin only) and dual hormone (insulin and glucagon)


These steps are well-documented on the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) [Artificial Pancreas Project Plan](http://jdrf.org/research/treat/artificial-pancreas-project/) page.


While the openaps tools do not limit a user, \#OpenAPS is focused on a single-hormone hybrid closed-loop system—that is, one that uses only insulin (no glucagon) and does not aim to replace user interaction for mealtime bolusing. A primer on the theory of operation for #OpenAPS can be found at the [\#OpenAPS Reference Design](http://openaps.org/open-artificial-pancreas-system-openaps-reference-design/) page.

# Ways to Contribute

* Do a fresh install using this guide and see where you get stuck; if you have to do something off-script, there is a reasonable chance the script is either wrong or your case is "special" and should be accounted for here
* Ask questions on gitter; if your question that wasn't answered in this doc gets answered there, chances are it should be included hereâ€”go ahead and add it to the appropriate section
* Submit issues on GitHub and work with other contributors to get them resolved

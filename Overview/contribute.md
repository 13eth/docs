# Ways to Contribute

Not everyone has the coding chops to dive in and start hacking away. That shouldn't stop you from contributing to the movement, however, as even the least seasoned code jockey can still find a way to help others and progress the project. Here are some ways to get involved:

* Do a fresh install using this guide and see where you get stuck; if you have to do something off-script, there is a reasonable chance the script is either wrong or your case is "special" and should be accounted for here. Make edits and submit a pull request to change the document and assist others.
* Ask questions on [gitter]( https://gitter.im/nightscout/intend-to-bolus); if your question that wasn't answered in this doc and gets answered there, chances are it should be included hereâ€”go ahead and add it to the appropriate section.
* Test the openaps tools for different use cases and report back with your findings. Logs files and, if you're comfortable, associated device data (CareLink CSV files, for example) are extremely helpful for debugging.
* Submit issues on GitHub and work with other contributors to get them resolved.
* Develop a plugin to enhance the functionality or ease-of-use of openaps.
* Spread the word about #OpenAPS and get others involved; the more, the merrier.

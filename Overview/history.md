# Project History

*[Note: It would be nice to offer a brief history of #OpenAPS, decoding-carelink, insulaudit, et cetera here. To be honest, this is background information that I do not fully possess. I'd be happy to have some attributions to the early contributors and instigators as well as the tie-ins with #WeAreNotWaiting and Nightscoutâ€”not to assign credit necessarily, but rather to give some appropriate context. Shout-outs to other projects will go in the* Other Projects *section closer to the end.]*

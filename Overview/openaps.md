# #OpenAPS and openaps

\#OpenAPS stands for **Open** **A**(rtificial) **P**(ancreas) **S**(ystem). #OpenAPS is an open and transparent effort to make safe and effective basic Artificial Pancreas System (APS) technology widely available to more quickly improve and save as many lives as possible and reduce the burden of Type 1 diabetes. All versions of #OpenAPS are, and will remain, open source: free for open source projects, researchers, and non-profits to use, and available on an open and non-discriminatory basis for all commercial manufacturers to use in proprietary products if desired. A full description of the \#OpenAPS project and more details can be found at [openaps.org](http://openaps.org/).

openaps or `openaps`, on the other hand, is the core suite of software tools under development by the #OpenAPS community for use in an OpenAPS implementation.

This document will use \#OpenAPS to refer to the movement, `openaps` to refer to the software suite, and OpenAPS (no \#) to refer to an example build of the system. Context should make this disambiguation unnecessary.

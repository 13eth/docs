# #OpenAPS and openaps

\#OpenAPS stands for **Open** **A**(rtificial) **P**(ancreas) **S**(ystem). It is an open-source movement to develop an artificial pancreas using commercial medical devices, a few pieces of inexpensive hardware, and freely-available software. A full description of the \#OpenAPS project can be found at [openaps.org](http://openaps.org/).

openaps or `openaps`, on the other hand, is the core suite of software tools under development by the #OpenAPS community for use in an OpenAPS implementation.

This document will use \#OpenAPS to refer to the movement, openaps to refer to the software suite, and OpenAPS (no \#) to refer to an example build of the system. Hopefully context will make this disambiguation unnecessary.

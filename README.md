Introduction 
===================

`#OpenAPS` is a development tool, which provides an interface for users to build custom apps. A basic structure in to which a user can drop modules and content is provided. This tool fosters creativity as we collaborate and evaluate our work, by programming a custom solution to fit our needs, with the creation of an open source artificial pancreas, as patients with diabetes. A command-line interface is used and a graphical user interface (GUI) is unnecessary and not recommended.

Hardware Details
-------------------
**Raspberry Pi 2 Model B**

The Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2) model B is a credit-card sized single-board computer which is used as a development board, used to prototype various applications of #OpenAPS. The RPi2 primarily uses Linux kernel based operating systems, which must be installed by the user onto a micro SD card for the RPi2 to work. The RPi2 currently only supports Ubuntu, Raspbian, OpenELEC, and RISC OS. We recommend installing either Ubuntu or Raspbian. In this tutorial, you will learn how to do a "cableless" and "headless" install of Raspbian, so you may access and control the RPi2 via a SSH client on Windows/Mac OS X/Linux/iOS/Android.
 
The RPi2 has 4 USB ports, an ethernet port, an HDMI port, and a micro USB power-in jack that accepts 2.1 Amp power supplies. In this tutorial, you will need to access the USB ports, micro USB power-in jack, and possibly the Ethernet jack (if failure occurs).

**Micro SD Card**

An 8 GB micro SDHC card is recommended, that is class-4 or greater, and is a recognized name brand like SanDisk or Kingston. A list of verified working hardware (including SD cards) can be found [here](http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals).

**WiFi Adapter**

A minimalistic, unobrtusive WiFi USB adapter is recommended, to avoid damage to both the RPi2 and the adapter, since the RPi2 is being transported everywhere with the patient.

**2.1 Amp USB Battery Power Supply**

A large capacity power supply that is greater than 8000 mAh (milliAmp hours) is recommended for full day use. A battery with a form-factor that minimizes size is recommended, to allow the patient to be as ambulatory as possible. When you have a full #OpenAPS system implemented and working, you will want to have acquired multiple batteries to rotate and recharge.

**CareLink USB Stick**

Currently, the only supported device for uploading pump data and interfacing on the #OpenAPS is the CareLink USB stick. We recommend you purchase at least two sticks because if one breaks, acquiring another stick will take time and will delay development.

**Dexcom G4 Platinum System -- with or without Share**

The Dexcom G4 Platinum system, with or without Share features is required to use #OpenAPS. However, the Share platform is not used in #OpenAPS as the system is designed to operate without an Internet connection. In order to get the data, a micro USB to USB cable must be connected to the RPi2 to upload the data at specified times.


**Medtronic 522/722, 515/715, or 512/712 Series Insulin Pump**

These specific models of the Medtronic Paradigm series insulin pumps are the only compatible pumps that will work with #OpenAPS. Any other pump will not work. Security features have been added to any pump after the Medtronic 522 or 722 series insulin pumps making remote adjustments in insulin unfeasible at this point of time. However, with collaboration from industry, we hope to find partners who will let us use our pumps as we want to as patients.

Setting up the Raspberry Pi 2
-------------
In order to use the RPi2 with #OpenAPS development tools, the RPi2 must have an operating system installed and be set up in a very specific way. By far, the most convenient approach for setting up the RPi2 is by avoiding the use of cables, which is also known as a headless install. This is the quickest way to get up and running with your RPi2 and avoids frustration.

For the install, you will need:

>* Raspberry Pi 2
<br />
>* 8 GB SD Card
<br />
>* Low Profile USB WiFi Adapter
<br />
>* 2.1 Amp USB Power Supply
<br />
>* Micro USB cable 

1. **Getting Raspbian.** Raspbian is the recommended operating system for `#OpenAPS`. You can download the latest version of Raspbian [here](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest). Make sure to extract the ZIP file.

2. **Writing Raspbian to the Micro SD Card.** Please read this [excellent guide](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup). Please view the sections on flashing the SD card using Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, depending on which operating system you use.

3. **Configuring WiFi Settings** Mac users: You canâ€™t access EXT4 partitions without using 3rd party software. The easiest alternative it is to temporarily connect RPi to router with ethernet cable, SSH in (see below) and continue setting things up in /etc/network/interfaces to get the wifi running.     <br />
Keep the SD card in the reader in your computer. In this step, the WiFi interface is going to be configured in Raspbian, so that we can SSH in to the RPi2 and access the device remotely, such as on a computer or a mobile device via an SSH client, via the WiFi connection that we configure. Go to the directory where your SD card is with all of the files for running Raspbian on your RPi2, and open this file in a text editor.

>`/path/to/sd/card/etc/network/interfaces`

Edit the file so it looks like this: 

>auto lo
<br />
>iface lo inet loopback
<br />
>iface eth0 inet dhcp
<br />

>auto wlan0
<br />
>allow-hotplug wlan0
<br />
>iface wlan0 inet dhcp
<br />
>wpa-ssid "your-network-name"
<br />
>wpa-psk "password-here"
<br />

Obviously the quotes are removed when you enter your configuration information. Save the file (without adding any additional extensions to the end of the filename).

Now, put the SD card into the RPi2. Plug the compatible USB WiFi adapter in to the RPi2. Get a micro USB cable and plug the micro USB end into the side of the RPi2 and plug the USB side into the USB power supply. 

4.: **Testing SSH Access**

**Windows:** Make sure that the computer is connected to the same WiFi router that the RPi2 is using. Download PuTTY here [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html]. Hostname is `pi@raspberrypi.lan` and default password for the user `pi` is `raspberry`. The port should be set to 22 (by default), and the connection type should be set to SSH. Click `Open` to initiate the SSH session.

**Mac OS X:** Make sure that the computer is connected to the same WiFi router that the RPi2 is using.

Open Terminal and enter this command:

>`ssh pi@raspberrypi.lan`

Default password for the user `pi` is `raspberry`

**Linux:** Make sure that the computer is connected to the same WiFi router that the RPi2 is using.

Open Terminal and enter this command:

>`ssh pi@raspberrypi.lan`

Default password for the user `pi` is `raspberry`

**iOS:** First, you need to make your phone a hotspot and configure the WiFi connection in `step 3` to use the hotspot. Make sure that the iOS device is connected to the same WiFi network that the RPi2 is using. Download Serverauditor or Prompt 2 (use this if you have a visual impairment). Hostname is `pi@raspberrypi.lan` and the default password for the user `pi` is `raspberry`. The port should be set to 22 (by default), and the connection type should be set to SSH. 

**Android:** First, you need to make your phone a hotspot and configure the WiFi connection in `step 3` to use the hotspot. Make sure that the Android device is connected to the same WiFi network that the RPi2 is using. Download an SSH client in the Google Play store. Hostname is `pi@raspberrypi.lan` and the default password for the user `pi` is `raspberry`. The port should be set to 22 (by default), and the connection type should be set to SSH.

**Note:** If connecting to the RPi2 fails at this point, the easiest alternative it is to temporarily connect RPi to router with ethernet cable, and SSH in, given both the computer and the RPi2 are connected to the same router.

5.: **raspi-config**

Run

>`sudo raspi-config` 

to expand filesystem, change user password and set timezone (in internalization options)

6.: **Password-less login**

Secure your RPi2. Log out by executing

>`exit`

and copy your public SSH key into your RPi2 by entering

>`ssh-copy-id pi@raspberrypi.lan`

Now you should be able to log in without a password. Repeat `step 4` and try to SSH into the RPi2 without a password.

**Don't have an SSH key?** Follow this guide from GitHub to obtain one. [Link](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

7.: **sshd configuration**

Since we have no password, we need to disable password login. Open this file in nano text editor

>`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Change the following

>`# change it to no`
<br />
>`PermitRootLogin yes`
<br />
>`# uncomment and change it to no (remove the # sign in the following line)`
<br />
>`# PasswordAuthentication yes`
<br />

From now on you will be able to SSH in with your private SSH key only!

8.: **Update** Update the RPi2.

> `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`

Be patient while the packages install.

9.: **Watchdog** Now we are going to install watchdog, which restarts the RPi2 if it becomes unresponsive.

Enter in:

>`sudo apt-get install watchdog`

Then enter:

>`sudo modprobe bcm2708_wdog`

Then enter this line to open up the following file:

>`sudo nano /etc/modules`

At the bottom of the file add

>`bcm2708_wdog`

Add watchdog to startup applications

>`sudo update-rc.d watchdog defaults`

Edit its config file

>`sudo nano /etc/watchdog.conf`  <br />
<br />

>`# uncomment the following: (remove the # from the following lines)`
<br />
>`max-load-1`
<br />
>`watchdog-device`

Start watchdog by entering

>`sudo service watchdog start`

Working with OpenAPS
---------------------------------
For getting started, please follow this [guide](https://github.com/openaps/openaps).

In order to have a fully operating OpenAPS, you will need to execute OpenAPS with your preprogrammed scripts, either in Python or JavaScript, as a bash shell script, using cron, to schedule the OpenAPS to make dosing changes at a specified time. See this tutorial on [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). A tutorial on bash shell scripts is [here](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html)

You can create and support plugins for OpenAPS, specifically, as a "process" type of plugin. So by typing for example 

>`openaps device add calciob process --require input node iob.js` 

tells OpenAPS that `iob.js` is a "node script". This also means that it takes a single input, which we will call `input` and to internally name that as a device called `calciob`. So now the plugin shows up under `openaps use calciob -h` and if your run the use case there, as stated in the getting started guide, it actually runs the node script with the required arguments.

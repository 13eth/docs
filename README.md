# Introduction 

Welcome to the [openaps](https://github.com/openaps/openaps) documentation!

![Example OpenAPS Setup](./docs/IMG_1112.jpg)

`openaps` is a set of [development tools](https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7088.pdf) to support a self-driven Do-It-Yourself (DIY) implementation of an artificial pancreas based on the [OpenAPS reference design](http://openaps.org/open-artificial-pancreas-system-openaps-reference-design/).

The tools may be categorized as:

*  **monitor**—collecting data about environment, and operational status of devices and/or aggregating as much data as is relevant into one place

* **predict**—make predictions about what should happen next

* **control**—enacting changes, and feeding more data back into the **monitor**, closing the loop.

By proceeding using these tools or any piece within, you agree to the copyright (see LICENSE.txt for more information) and release any contributors from liability. 

##Note

This is a set of development tools to support a self-driven DIY implementation. Any person choosing to use these tools is solely responsible for testing and implementing these tools independently or together as a system.  

**The [DIY part of OpenAPS is important](http://bit.ly/1NBbZtO).** While formal training or experience as an engineer or a developer is not required, **what is required:**

* a growth mindset to learn what are essentially "building blocks" to implement an OpenAPS system. 
	
	* This is not a "set and forget" system; `OpenAPS` requires diligent and consistent testing and monitoring to ensure each piece of the system is monitoring, predicting, and controlling as desired.  The performance and quality of your system lies solely with you.

**This community of contributors believes in paying it forward, and individuals who are implementing these tools are asked to contribute by asking questions, helping improve documentation, and contribute in other ways.**

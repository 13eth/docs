# Introduction 

`#OpenAPS` is a development tool that provides an interface for users to build custom apps. A basic structure in to which a user can drop modules and content is provided. This tool fosters creativity as we collaborate and evaluate our work, by programming a custom solution to fit our needs, with the creation of an open source artificial pancreas, as patients with diabetes. A command-line interface is used and a graphical user interface (GUI) is unnecessary and not recommended.

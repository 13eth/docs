# Building an OpenAPS Implementation

This section describes how to go from using the openaps tools in isolation to building your own OpenAPS implementation. For a number or reasons, this document can neither provide explicit instructions on how to construct a functional artificial pancreas nor recommend that you use the openaps tools for dosing insulin. What can be provided is an approach that can help guide this transition through a series of phases. 

In each phase, I'm looking to accomplish a set of goals as well as gain some further abilities to contribute back to the OpenAPS community. For me, there are five phases:


* [Phase 0: Initial Setup](Building-a-system/initial-setup.md)
* [Phase 1: Data Collection](Building-a-system/data-collection.md)
* [Phase 2: Recommendation Engine](Building-a-system/recommendation-engine.md)
* [Phase 3: Closing the Loop](Building-a-system/closing-the-loop.md)
* [Phase 4: Getting Fancy](Building-a-system/getting-fancy.md)

Each subsection has three components:
* Upon Completion
* Phase Tasks
* Community Contribution


Phase III: Close the Loop

I won't bother go into the details here as they aren't relevant to the write-up I'm suggesting
Phase IV: Gild the Lily

This is all the awesome stuff that everyone dreams of (and is certainly worthwhile) but tends to distract in the early stages; again, I won't jump into this at the moment

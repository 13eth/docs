# Phase 1: Data Collection
Phase 1 focuses on accessing, logging, cleaning up, and analyzing data from the pump and CGM.

* Upon Completion
    * Be able to download, record, and recall data logs from pump and CGM
    * Be able to download “real time” data
    * Have data being sent via wireless connection to a cloud database for user access
    * Have built a system able to collect data and be able to help others do the same


* Phase Tasks
    * Use tools to download data from pump and CGM
    * Log data for future analysis, use in algorithms
    * Ensure fidelity and accuracy of recorded readings
    * Test edge cases
    * Log data “in real time” to test hardware functionality
    * Set up cloud database to accept uploaded data (optional)
    * Have logged data syncing to cloud database


* Community Contribution
    * Provide feedback on ...
        * Model-specific data issues (e.g. Medtronic 722 v 723)
        * Using software tools
        * Following guides to accomplish above phase tasks
    * Help edit instructions for Phase I
    * Provide improved or alternative implementations
